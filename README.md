# UCCF Christian Union List

This is a small demonstration project that fetches data from UCCF’s public API
and displays a list of Christian Unions in a simple, readable format.

The aim is to show a clear, understandable approach to working with external APIs
and presenting data in a user-friendly way, rather than building a full application.
